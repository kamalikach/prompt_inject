      "## Review of \"Machine Learning with Privacy for Protected Attributes\"\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper, \"Machine Learning with Privacy for Protected Attributes,\" introduces Feature Differential Privacy (FDP), a significant refinement of the standard Differential Privacy (DP) definition. The core motivation is to address the often-prohibitive utility cost of applying full-dataset DP when only specific \"protected attributes\" within data records require privacy protection. By allowing other \"public\" features to be utilized more freely, FDP aims to achieve a better privacy-utility trade-off.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Summary of Contributions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors propose a novel, simulation-based definition of FDP that accommodates both addition/removal and replacement variants of privacy, and is flexible enough to handle arbitrary and adaptive separation of protected and non-protected features via a public feature map Ψ. Key technical contributions include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Formal Definition of FDP:** A rigorous f-DP based definition that extends to insertion/deletion adjacency through a clever simulator-based approach.\n",
      "2.  **Privacy Properties:** Proofs for adaptive composition and a demonstration of FDP's implications for limiting attribute inference attacks on private features.\n",
      "3.  **FDP-SGD Algorithm:** A modification of the standard DP-SGD algorithm (Algorithm 1) that satisfies FDP. This variant tackles two crucial challenges: disentangling public and private signals by decomposing the loss function into private and public components, and, critically, enabling privacy amplification via sub-sampling by using two separate mini-batches for public and private gradients. This latter point notably answers an open question regarding label differential privacy.\n",
      "4.  **Utility Analysis:** Theoretical convergence results for FDP-SGD in convex optimization settings, demonstrating improved excess risk bounds compared to standard DP-SGD, particularly for Label-DP.\n",
      "5.  **Empirical Validation:** Extensive experiments on various ML tasks, including classification (Purchase100, Criteo) and generative modeling with diffusion models (AFHQ, LSUN). The results show substantial utility improvements over traditional DP-trained models, particularly in image generation tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strengths:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Strong Motivation and Practical Relevance:** The paper addresses a critical practical limitation of standard DP. In many real-world scenarios, not all information within a data record is equally sensitive. FDP provides a principled framework to leverage non-sensitive information for better model utility without compromising privacy on sensitive attributes. The examples (license plates, PII, specific tabular columns) are highly relatable.\n",
      "2.  **Novel and Flexible Definition:** The f-DP based and simulation-based definitions of FDP are technically sound and highly flexible. The ability to define Ψ as an arbitrary function allows for broad applicability across different data modalities and privacy needs.\n",
      "3.  **Overcoming Technical Hurdles:** The proposed Algorithm 1 for FDP-SGD is a crucial technical innovation. The observation that feature-DP (unlike standard DP) generally does not benefit from sub-sampling amplification, and the subsequent solution of using two separate batches, is clever and essential for practical large-scale machine learning. This directly addresses and answers an open question from previous work on Label-DP (Ghazi et al., 2021).\n",
      "4.  **Compelling Empirical Results:** The experimental section provides strong evidence of FDP's benefits. The drastic improvement in FID scores for diffusion models on AFHQ and LSUN (e.g., from 286.7 to 101.9 at ϵ=8 on AFHQ) is particularly impressive and visually evident in the generated samples. This demonstrates that FDP can enable applications that are otherwise unfeasible with traditional DP.\n",
      "5.  **Rigorous Analysis:** The paper provides theoretical guarantees for FDP properties (composition, attribute inference) and for the convergence and privacy of the proposed FDP-SGD algorithm.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Weaknesses and Limitations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Determination of Public Features (Ψ):** While the paper assumes the public feature map Ψ is given, the most significant practical challenge for FDP's deployment lies in the *a priori* and *robust* determination of what constitutes a \"public\" versus \"private\" feature. Misclassifying sensitive features as public could lead to privacy breaches. The paper acknowledges this in the \"Considerations for public leakage\" section, stating that \"the choice of the public feature will be determined by the privacy requirements; it is not a design choice for us.\" However, real-world application requires robust methodologies for this. This problem is non-trivial and involves complex ethical, legal, and domain-specific considerations. Prior work, such as **Broyles et al. (2018)**, has explored methods for identifying sensitive attributes, but integrating such identification mechanisms directly into the FDP framework and ensuring their robustness against adversarial analysis remains an open research direction not directly addressed here.\n",
      "2.  **Modest Gains on Criteo:** The utility gains on the Criteo dataset were observed to be relatively small compared to Purchase100 and the image generation tasks. The authors provide a plausible explanation related to the signal content of the chosen public features, which is transparent. However, it underscores that the benefits of FDP are context-dependent and heavily rely on the quality and informational content of the chosen public features.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Clarity and Presentation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "The paper is well-written and well-organized. The definitions are clear, and the motivation for FDP is compellingly articulated with illustrative examples. The distinction from prior related work is thoroughly discussed, highlighting the specific advantages of FDP. The experimental setup and results are presented clearly, including qualitative examples for image generation. The inclusion of a meta-review and proofs in the appendix adds to the overall quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Overall Recommendation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "This paper presents a timely and highly relevant contribution to the field of privacy-preserving machine learning. Feature Differential Privacy offers a practical and theoretically sound approach to mitigate the utility costs often associated with strict differential privacy guarantees. The novel FDP definition, coupled with the specialized DP-SGD algorithm that leverages subsampling amplification, represents a significant step forward. The strong empirical results, particularly in generative models, further bolster its impact. Despite the acknowledged practical challenges in defining public features, the framework itself is robust and adaptable. This paper is a valuable addition to the privacy literature and should be accepted.\n",
